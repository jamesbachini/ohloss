**BLENDIZZARD: Where DeFi Meets Competitive Gaming on Stellar**

GM Stellar fam! We're excited to share what we've been building - a faction-based game protocol that turns your yield into rewards.

**How it works:**

1. **Deposit USDC** → Your funds earn BLND yield via Blend protocol's fee-vault
2. **Pick your faction** → WholeNoodle, PointyStick, or SpecialRock
3. **Earn Faction Points (FP)** → Based on deposit amount + time held (with multiplier curves)
4. **Play games** → Wager FP against other players in whitelisted game contracts
5. **Win together** → Every 4 days, the faction with most FP contributed shares the USDC rewards

**The catch?** When you play, BOTH players' wagers get burned. Only the winner's FP counts toward their faction's score. This creates scarcity - every game matters, strategy matters, and timing matters.

**Why it's exciting:**

- **Your capital works for you** - Earn yield while competing
- **Powerful multipliers** - $1K deposit gets ~2.45x FP, 35 days holding gets ~2.45x time bonus = **6x combined**
- **Anti-gaming mechanics** - Withdraw >50% between epochs? Time multiplier resets to zero
- **Faction warfare** - Coordinate with your team to dominate the epoch
- **Built on Soroban** - Fast, cheap, and secure smart contracts on Stellar

**Current Status:**
✅ 61/61 tests passing
✅ Full security audit documentation
✅ Ready for testnet deployment
⏳ Awaiting external audit for mainnet

**Tech Stack:**
- Soroban smart contracts (Rust)
- Blend protocol integration (fee-vault-v2)
- Soroswap DEX (BLND → USDC conversion)
- ZK proof verification (coming in Phase 4)

This isn't just another yield farm - it's competitive DeFi where your strategy, timing, and faction loyalty determine rewards.

**Tweet 1/8** 🧵
We're building Blendizzard - a faction-based competitive gaming protocol on @StellarOrg's Soroban

Deposit USDC, earn yield, compete in games, share rewards with your faction

Here's how it works 👇

**Tweet 2/8**
📍 Step 1: Deposit USDC into Blend protocol's fee-vault

Your capital immediately starts earning BLND yield while you play

No lockups. Withdraw anytime (but there are consequences... more on that later)

**Tweet 3/8**
🎭 Step 2: Choose your faction

• WholeNoodle 🍜
• PointyStick 🪵
• SpecialRock 🪨

Once you play your first game of an epoch, you're locked in. Choose wisely.

**Tweet 4/8**
⚡ Step 3: Earn Faction Points (FP)

FP = deposit amount × amount multiplier × time multiplier

Multipliers use smooth piecewise curves:
• $1K deposit → ~2.45x boost
• 35 days holding → ~2.45x boost
• Stack them for **6x max**

Flash deposits don't work here 😎

**Tweet 5/8**
🎮 Step 4: Play games & wager FP

Here's the twist: When a game ends, BOTH players' wagers are burned

Only the WINNER's FP counts toward their faction's score

This creates scarcity - FP supply decreases every game. Strategy matters.

**Tweet 6/8**
🏆 Step 5: Epoch ends (every 4 days)

Faction with highest FP contributed wins

Accumulated BLND yield auto-converts to USDC via @SoroswapFinance

Winners split rewards proportionally based on FP contribution

**Tweet 7/8**
🛡️ Anti-gaming mechanics:

• Withdraw >50% between epochs? Time multiplier resets to 0
• Faction switching? Only before first game
• Flash deposits? Time multiplier starts at 1.0x
• Replay attacks? Session IDs are unique

Built to resist exploitation

**Tweet 8/8**
Why we're excited:

✅ Capital efficiency (earn while playing)
✅ Team-based competition
✅ Sustainable tokenomics
✅ Built on Soroban (fast + cheap)
✅ 61/61 tests passing
✅ Full security docs

Testnet soon. Mainnet after external audit.

### Version A: Feature-focused thread (5 tweets)

Blendizzard: Competitive DeFi on @StellarOrg Soroban

Deposit → Earn yield → Play games → Win rewards with your faction

Built different. Here's why 🧵

**Tweet 2/5**
💰 Your deposits earn BLND yield via Blend protocol while you compete

🎭 Pick a faction (WholeNoodle/PointyStick/SpecialRock) and lock in for 4-day epochs

⚡ Earn Faction Points with multipliers: $1K = 2.45x, 35 days = 2.45x = **6x combined**

**Tweet 3/5**
🎮 Game mechanics that create scarcity:

When you play, BOTH wagers burn. Only winner's FP counts.

FP supply shrinks every game. Every decision matters. No spam strategies.

**Tweet 4/5**
🛡️ Anti-gaming design:

• Time multiplier resets on >50% withdrawals
• Flash deposits don't work (time multiplier starts at 1.0x)
• Faction locked after first game
• Smooth piecewise curves prevent whale dominance

**Tweet 5/5**
🚀 Status:

✅ 61/61 tests passing
✅ Security audit docs complete
✅ Testnet ready
⏳ External audit for mainnet

This is competitive DeFi built right.

### Version B: Narrative-driven (6 tweets)

**Tweet 1/6**
What if your DeFi deposits could do more than just earn yield?

What if they became your competitive edge in faction warfare?

Introducing Blendizzard on @StellarOrg Soroban 🧵

**Tweet 2/6**
The concept: Deposit USDC into Blend's vault. Earn BLND yield. Use that capital to generate Faction Points.

But here's where it gets interesting...

**Tweet 3/6**
Those FP aren't just numbers. They're your ammunition.

Wager them in games. Win? Your FP contribute to your faction's score.

Lose? Your FP burn. Gone forever.

Every 4 days, winning faction splits the USDC rewards.

**Tweet 4/6**
The math is elegant:

FP = deposit × amount_multiplier × time_multiplier

Multipliers use smooth piecewise curves. Whales get diminishing returns. Time commitment matters.

A $1K deposit held 35 days = **6x FP** vs fresh deposit.

**Tweet 5/6**
Security built in:

• Withdraw >50%? Lose time multiplier
• Try to faction switch? Locked after first game
• Flash loan attack? Time multiplier = 1.0x for new deposits

It's designed to reward sustained commitment, not gaming.

**Tweet 6/6**
Built on Soroban. Fast, cheap, secure.

61/61 tests passing. Full security documentation. Ready for testnet.

This is what competitive DeFi looks like.

## Key Talking Points to Emphasize

1. **Capital efficiency** - Earn yield while gaming (vs idle assets)
2. **Powerful multipliers** - Up to 6x FP for sustained deposits ($1K + 35 days)
3. **Anti-whale mechanics** - Smooth piecewise curves prevent dominance
4. **Scarcity model** - FP burns create deflationary pressure
5. **Team coordination** - Faction-based rewards encourage cooperation
6. **Security-first** - Comprehensive testing and audit documentation
7. **Soroban advantages** - Fast, cheap transactions on Stellar
8. **Sustainable** - No inflationary token, rewards from real yield
9. **Strategic depth** - Multipliers, timing, faction choice all matter

## FAQ Snippets (for replies/engagement)

**Q: What happens to my deposit if I lose games?**
A: Your deposit stays in the vault earning yield. Only FP (derived from your deposit) is wagered. If you lose, that FP burns but your USDC remains.

**Q: Can I withdraw anytime?**
A: Yes, but withdraw >50% between epochs and your time multiplier resets to 0. This prevents deposit timing manipulation.

**Q: How are rewards calculated?**
A: At epoch end, winning faction's total USDC reward pool is split proportionally based on each player's FP contribution during the epoch.

**Q: What's the minimum deposit?**
A: No minimum, but multipliers use smooth piecewise curves. Deposits get peak FP boost at $1K (2.45x), then gradually decrease back to 1.0x at $10K. Similarly, time peaks at 35 days, drops back to 1.0x at 245 days (35 weeks).

**Q: When mainnet?**
A: After external security audit (8-13 weeks estimated). Testnet deployment imminent.

**Q: Can I change factions?**
A: Change anytime UNTIL you play your first game of an epoch. Then you're locked for those 4 days.
