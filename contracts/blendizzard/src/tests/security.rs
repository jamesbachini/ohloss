/// Test: Withdrawal Reset Timing Exploit Prevention
///
/// Original vulnerability: Users could withdraw 49.9% and re-deposit repeatedly
/// to avoid crossing the 50% threshold, maintaining high time multiplier while
/// extracting capital.
///
/// Fix: When user deposits during an epoch where they've previously withdrawn,
/// reset withdrawn_this_epoch to 0 and update initial_epoch_balance.
///
/// This test verifies:
/// 1. User can withdraw under 50% threshold multiple times
/// 2. Balances are tracked correctly through deposit/withdraw cycles
/// 3. The fix prevents gaming the threshold
