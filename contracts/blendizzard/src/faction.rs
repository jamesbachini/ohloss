// ============================================================================
// Faction Selection
// ============================================================================

/// Select a faction for the player
///
/// This sets the player's persistent faction preference for future epochs.
/// Players can change their faction selection at ANY time - this updates their
/// preference but does NOT affect the current epoch if already locked.
///
/// Architecture:
/// - `Player.selected_faction` - Persistent preference (can always change)
/// - `EpochPlayer.epoch_faction` - Locked for current epoch on first game (cannot change)
///
/// Behavior:
/// - Changing faction updates your persistent preference immediately
/// - If you haven't played a game this epoch, next game uses new faction
/// - If you've already played this epoch, current epoch stays locked to old faction
/// - New selection applies starting next epoch
///
/// # Arguments
/// * `env` - Contract environment
/// * `player` - Player selecting the faction
/// * `faction` - Faction ID (0=WholeNoodle, 1=PointyStick, 2=SpecialRock)
///
/// # Errors
/// * `InvalidFaction` - If faction ID is not 0, 1, or 2
